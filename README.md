The folder turbine contains solution to solution to fun problems. All solutions are in one class named "TurbineApplication". However, test cases are different for different problems. Each solution has a small line from original problem. To find reference in internal doc for full problem, simply search for the subpart of the problem (mentioned in code above each solution) in the doc.


Note that most solutions are written under the assumption that the input is valid other than possibility of null and empty objects (as is the case with most interviews). However, it is recommended to discuss with the interviewer regarding the situation of the input data and make changes accordingly.
